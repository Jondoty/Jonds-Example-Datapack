Jond's Example Datapack
A datapack to document and simplify features of Jond's maps to work with. 

This datapack contains examples of a dialogue used in my maps with an auto-configuring work platform that will spawn when the player first logs in with the map. Remove the "autorun.mcfunction" file after first spawn-in setup if you have multiple players connecting to the map!
